# Arya-Voice-Based-HomeAutomation
A smart and affortable voice based home automation system using Arduino and Android to control electrical appliances.With the help of bluetooth technology this complete system is developed.

Technology Used:
♦ Arduino Uno
♦ HC-05 Bluetooth Module
♦ 4-Channel Relay Module
♦ Android Studio (To command arduino using android phone)


Coding Part:

  The whole project is divided in two levels : 1) Hardware 2) Software
  
  1) At hardware end every thing is coded on Arduino IDE. Hardware end will recieve data from android phone and based on logics         done in arduino code it will trigger some actions like on or off. 
  2) At software end android studio is used to code how to connect to bluetooth and give command via voice to arduino. Arduino will do the rest.
